# dotfiles

For me, the most suitable way to manage dotfiles involves using a bare git repository.
Such setup is explained in a [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797)
and in [this blog post](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

Also, [dotfiles are meant to be forked](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).
